      The Internet is so big, so powerful and pointless that for some people it
      is a complete substitute for life. ~ Andrew Brown Elon Musk recently
      remarked that the Metaverse appears to be more of a marketing buzz word
      than a reality. After retweeting a video of David Letterman slamming the
      internet, Musk made the remark. The term 'Metaverse' is coined from the
      words: 'Meta' and 'Verse.' 'Meta' is originated from Greek and is a prefix
      that signifies 'Beyond.' The term 'metaverse' refers to a verse that has
      been made artificially. The internet can be considered a unique version of
      the metaverse, it is limited just to our digital screens. However, when
      the term "metaverse" is used, it refers to an universe in which you can
      immerse yourself totally in three dimensions like our physical world. This
      term gained momentum when Facebook changed their corporate name to Meta
      and stated that they wanted to enter the Metaverse space. Basically this
      term was originally used in Neal Stephenson's science fiction novel "Snow
      Crash" published in 1992. When Metaverse is talked about Blockchains and
      cryptocurrencies are hot topics. In today's society, where technology is
      an integral part of our hectic daily lives, the most popular technology is
      simple to use and delivers a clear benefit to the user. Now that I’ve
      realised, I’ve dedicated large part of this article on Metaverse, let’s
      get back to Elon Musk’s tweet. Now that statement is technically correct
      as it says the term metaverse is currently being used as a “Marketing
      Buzzword” by many companies to attract technophile like us who want to
      explore the Metaverse space. However, we can't say it's confined to that.
      Imagine being able to go to work and do your work from anywhere in the
      world, even if you don't have your devices because they exist in the
      Metaverse. Consider how much more enjoyable games may be when played in
      the Metaverse with real-world experience. The metaverse is an infinite
      verse of untapped potential that is just waiting to be discovered. The
      technology's use case is spectacular as it improves and advances. Unlike
      Facebook, which binds its users to live in a bubble of information and
      significant data that is classified by the Facebook algorithm. You stay in
      your bubble and are only presented what you want to see, which is the root
      of polarisation. Furthermore, if this virtual environment becomes so
      fascinating and engrossing in some way, individuals will lose interest in
      the real world. This is a dystopian scenario. The word "dystopian" comes
      from the novel Snow Crash, which is a dystopian fiction. It describes how
      the motion of the real world will be disrupted by this manufactured
      universe. Many corporate tycoons, in my opinion, see the metaverse as a
      more substantial investment with more with more potential, but do we
      really need to isolate ourselves from the actual world to the point that
      we forget how to live in it? That we have to live our entire lives in this
      fictitious, manufactured universe?
